Converter
=========
It is a converter which converts one file format to another. I have took an example of some .gd and .gne file formats. It can be compiled by using the script a.sh and using conv.gd and conv.gne as input files for testing.

Install dependencies :-

<code>
$ sudo apt-get install flex bison 
</code>

Commands to compile this code are :-

<code>
$ bash a.sh
$ ./conv
</code>
